            <a href="" class="question">What is STEAM?</a>
            <p class="answer" id="1">
              STEAM is a curriculum based on the idea of educating students in
              FIVE specific disciplines — Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts
              and Mathematics — in an interdisciplinary and applied approach.
              Rather than teach the four disciplines as separate and discrete
              subjects, STEAM integrates them into a cohesive learning paradigm
              based on real-world applications. What separates STEAM from the
              traditional science and math education is the blended learning
              environment and showing students how the scientific method can be
              applied to everyday life. It teaches students computational
              thinking and focuses on the real world applications of problem
              solving

            <a href="" class="question"
              >Why is STEAM Important at school level?</a
            >
            <p class="answer">
              Elementary school — STEAM education focuses on the introductory
              level STEAM courses, as well as awareness of the STEAM fields.
              This initial step provides standards-based structured
              inquiry-based and real world problem-based learning, connecting
              all four of the STEAM subjects. Middle school — Student awareness
              of STEAM fields is still pursued, as well as the academic
              requirements of such fields. Student exploration of STEAM related
              careers begins at this level, particularly for underrepresented
              populations. High school — The program of study focuses on the
              application of the subjects in a challenging and rigorous manner.
              Courses and pathways are now available in STEAM fields and
              occupations, as well as preparation for post-secondary education.
